I am Magdalena and passionate about digital chemistry and science communication.

From transition metals over student hacks to coding news: I built this blog to document comments and resources that fascinate me and help others.

Furthermore, I am a passionate pumpkin aficionada (the photo above shows me with a high yield of rare *cucurbitaceae*).
