# Welcome to BytzeSizedChem!
Finally – It has been a hot minute.

Hello there! I’m Magdalena, holding a BSc ETH in Chemistry (which is important for this blog’s acronym). I started BytzeSizedChem (BSC) with the goal of:

* Practicing a habit of consistent writing (it’s a muscle!),
* Transitioning from “student” to “researcher” while remaining a life-long learner,
* Building an atlas and community for digital chemists.

I’m excited to share many ideas with you! Here, I aim to share ideas, findings, and discussions in a safe and open space.

### Some upcoming posts include:

* Coding Essentials for New Digital Chemists
* Making of a Scientific Poster
* AI is IN: Chemical Education with Digital Tools
* ChatGPT goes Chemistry: Build your own Large Language Model Agent
* Networking for Nerds

This website contains detailed content, context, and code snippets. For short summaries and – most importantly – for staying updated about upcoming posts, check out my [Substacl](). You will be notified by updates right here, making it super easy to stay informed by subscribing.

Very much looking forward to this journey with you! Ad astra 🚀✨
