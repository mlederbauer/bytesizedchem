Finally! Welcome! It has been a hot minute.
This is a blog about a digital chemistry nerd. I am passionate about the field and am continuously learning.

If you have any ideas or content that you would like to have featured or discussed here, please don't hesitate to reach out on [Twitter](twitter.com/maglederb), [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/magdalena-lederbauer) or [email](mlederbauer@ethz.ch). Any feedback or redistribution is highly appreciated!

In a bit, I will launch a feature that enables you to subscribe to the blog.

Cheers,
