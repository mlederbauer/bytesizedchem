Hello there! I am writing a lot of reports, applications and text in LaTeX right now, and there is one tag that has caused me headache for the past years:

```
\ce{}
```

The chemical equation command by the usepackage `mhchem`. It is not math mode, making your text automatically be weirdly *tiltedandsquishedtogether*, it automatically recognizes ‚Çõ·µ§b- and À¢·µò·µñ·µâ ≥script. It is everything for keeping me sane when describing molecules‚Äô sum formulae and salts.

The Problem?

While I can mark text with my cursor and simply hit `Cmd+B` and make every text bold, while I can highlight, hit `$` and transform a line of math into math-mode like a breeze ‚Äì is a pain to insert this `\ce{}` tag

One day, I got too annoyed and searched for a shortcut for this. With success!!

Let me introduce you to [Shortleaf](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shortleaf/hmkemgnhfglmggklpfodjgkabaicchjn), a Google Chrome extension that lets you create your own Overleaf shortcuts. For literally anything.

I found out about it in a reddit post (I can‚Äôt find anymore ü•≤) and downloaded it from the [Google Chrome extension store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/shortleaf/hmkemgnhfglmggklpfodjgkabaicchjn). [This is the repo](https://github.com/andre-al/shortleaf) you can look at (or star, as the author ‚Äì Andre Alcantara ‚Äì, has done such a good job), and this is the custom command you can add*:

(Another useful command if you are using the LuaLaTeX compiler: ‚ú®‚ú®)

With Cmd+E, you can now insert \ce{} at your free will, or mark any text to transform it into a beautiful ~sulfuric acid~ or ~isotopomer of ¬π‚Å¥C¬π‚Å∏O~. No hassle involved anymore. Needless to say, it only works on Overleaf at the moment.

I sincerely hope it is turning out as useful to you as it did for me. Please give Andre‚Äôs ([@andre_alc_](https://x.com/andre_alc_) on Twitter) repo a star or his post a ‚ù§Ô∏è if you benefit from it. Supporters supporting supporters!
