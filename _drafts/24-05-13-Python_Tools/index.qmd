I see this more as a collection of ressources for someone in the natural sciences to 

# How to set up a coding project

inspiration: Heads First Design Principles (by the way a ressource many students have access too -- se previous post on learning to code)

Most important points

# Coding etiquette


# So what about Open Source?

# How to get started
