I've been approached by ...

At my home university, we were confronted with programming from an early academic age one.

How To Learn To Code?

Learning Python

Learning the Programming Interface

Learning Machine Learning (Machine Learning Machine Learning... You're A Learning Machine)

- Kaggle
- Codecademny (watch out for Sales promos around New Years, Black Friday and the beginning of the School Year! Gamifying the Experience like a gentle Duolingo)
- introtodeeplearning

- GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT: Handle with care. Not only do they love to hallucinate (train-test-leakage, hello!), they are also depreceated and sometimes don't contain the newest/most efficient versions. Super helpful to get unstuck on a problem, but not the usable solution. Also a great teacher, by the way. Good alternatives to ChatGPT is perplecity.ai.

- Hands-On-Projects!
Just ASK! Think of interesting problems.
I wanted to build my own budgeting program (and failed miserably, by the way)
