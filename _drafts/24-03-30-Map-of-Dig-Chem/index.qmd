I have the honour of presenting some of my work and research interests in the "Meet the Talent" event at ETH Zurich in April! This is an event organized by the ETH Foundation to showcase some of the work that fellow ESOP scholars haver done or are interested in. I thought that this would be a fantastic opportunity to sketch out a little "map of digital chemistry". So, let's do it!

This post is about the process of obtaining the "Map of Digital Chemistry". For the final post/illustration and poster see a later post. This post will be continuously updated â€“ also, please feel free to send me any feedback or suggestions via [e-mail](mlederbauer@ethz.ch) or the social media credentials above.
