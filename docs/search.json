    "text": "Augmenting Chemistry with Digital Tools\nDigital Chemistry is a young field that combines Computational Chemistry, Cheminformatics, Software Engineering and AI to accelerate the discovery of materials, apply machine learning methods to chemical problems and build actionable tools for researchers. As traditional chemistry emphasizes important hands-on synthetic and analytical methods, the recent digital shift requires strong skills in programming, navigating coding environments, data analysis, and developing reproducible machine learning pipelines. Critically assessing published works for reproducibility is essential, reflecting a broader trend of increasing retractions in scientific publishing (2).1"

    "section": "The Practical Implications",
    "text": "The Practical Implications\nSimilar to wet-lab chemistry, expertise in programming grows with experience. Effective learning in this domain is achieved through hands-on projects, from academic coursework over research to personal mini-projects. Building a machine learning pipeline, for example, mirrors the process of planning and conducting a chemical synthesis.\nThe community is encouraged to embrace mentorship and foster an environment of support and openness. As chemists increasingly transition to computer science, they bring a dual perspective that enriches our approach to both fields. Our collective goal is to maximize the utility of data and algorithms, integrating them seamlessly with established chemical knowledge.\n\nIn response to these needs, we have curated a comprehensive list of digital chemistry learning resources available on GitHub at mlederbauer/awesome-learning-digital-chemistry, promoting open contribution and accessibility to all interested parties.\n\n\n1. Blaiszik, B. blaiszik/ml_publication_charts: AI/ML Publication Statistics for 2022, 2023. doi:10.5281/zenodo.7713954.\n\n\n2. Van Noorden, R. More than 10,000 research papers were retracted in 2023 - a new record. Nature 2023, 624(7992), 479‚Äì481."
